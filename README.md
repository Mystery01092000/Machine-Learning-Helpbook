## Part 1: Introduction to Machine Learning:

#### Definition:(What is Machine Learning):

   Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[3] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
####    In simple words, we design or code a machine in such a way that we provide some data to the machine, it processes it to learn from it and hence do predictions.
The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

## Aplications of Machine Learning in Our day to day life
#### Following are some of the applications of Machine Learning around us:

## 1. Virtual Personal Assistant 
      Siri, Alexa, Bixby, Google Now are some of the most common virtual personal assistants.  As the name suggests, they assist in finding information, when asked over voice. 
      Machine learning is an important part of these personal assistants as they collect and refine the information on the basis of your previous involvement with them. Later, this set of data is utilized to render results that are tailored to your preferences.
      
      Virtual Assistants are integrated to a variety of platforms. For example:
      > Smart Speakers: Amazon Echo and Google Home
      > Smartphones: Samsung Bixby on Samsung S8
      > Mobile Apps: Google Allo
      
## 2. Prediction while Commuting
   Traffic Predictions:
         
         We all have been using GPS navigation services. While we do that, our current locations and velocities are being saved at a central server for managing traffic. This data is then used to build a map of current traffic. While this helps in preventing the traffic and does congestion analysis, the underlying problem is that there are less number of cars that are equipped with GPS. Machine learning in such scenarios helps to estimate the regions where congestion can be found on the basis of daily experiences.
         
   Online Transportation Networks: 
   
         When booking a cab, the app estimates the price of the ride. When sharing these services, how do they minimize the detours? The answer is machine learning. Jeff Schneider, the engineering lead at Uber ATC reveals in a an interview that they use ML to define price surge hours by predicting the rider demand. In the entire cycle of the services, ML is playing a major role.
         
   
## 3. Videos Surveillance

      The video surveillance system nowadays are powered by AI that makes it possible to detect crime before they happen. They track unusual behaviour of people like standing motionless for a long time, stumbling, or napping on benches etc. The system can thus give an alert to human attendants, which can ultimately help to avoid mishaps. And when such activities are reported and counted to be true, they help to improve the surveillance services. This happens with machine learning doing its job at the backend.
      
## 4. Social Media Services
   
      From personalizing your news feed to better ads targeting, social media platforms are utilizing machine learning for their own and user benefits. Here are a few examples that you must be noticing, using, and loving in your social media accounts, without realizing that these wonderful features are nothing but the applications of ML.
      Examples: 
      1. People You May Know
      2. Face Recognition 
      3. Similar Pins
    
## 5.  Email Spam and Malware Filtering
      
         This is a very common feature we see everyday in our message box, mail box or call logs. There are Machine learning used to prefect malware and spam to get in notice or are filtered as for convinience and fraud protection.
         
## 6. Online Customer Support
   
         A number of websites nowadays offer the option to chat with customer support representative while they are navigating within the site. However, not every website has a live executive to answer your queries. In most of the cases, you talk to a chatbot. These bots tend to extract information from the website and present it to the customers. Meanwhile, the chatbots advances with time. They tend to understand the user queries better and serve them with better answers, which is possible due to its machine learning algorithms.
      
## 7. Search Engine Result Refining

      Google and other search engines use machine learning to improve the search results for you. Every time you execute a search, the algorithms at the backend keep a watch at how you respond to the results. If you open the top results and stay on the web page for long, the search engine assumes that the the results it displayed were in accordance to the query. Similarly, if you reach the second or third page of the search results but do not open any of the results, the search engine estimates that the results served did not match requirement. This way, the algorithms working at the backend improve the search results.


## 8. Product Recommendations

      Ever wonder why the things you search for comes in your way everytime you go through any site? Ever wonder on what basis you get suggestions for buying something after you first purchase or even before. You shopped for a product online few days back and then you keep receiving emails for shopping suggestions. If not this, then you might have noticed that the shopping website or the app recommends you some items that somehow matches with your taste. Certainly, this refines the shopping experience but did you know that itâ€™s machine learning doing the magic for you? On the basis of your behaviour with the website/app, past purchases, items liked or added to cart, brand preferences etc., the product recommendations are made.
