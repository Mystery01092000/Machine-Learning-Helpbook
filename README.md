# Welcome to the Machine Learning HelpBook

#### So throught this repo I am going to briefly describe the steps and provide resources for absolute beginners to develop an understanding towards machine learning.
#### This repository will have a theoritical and mathematical aspect as well as practical aspect of Machine Learning.
## Index:
#### 1. Introduction and Basic Definition
#### 2. Types of Machine Learning.
#### 3. How to get started and beginning with coding part(Jupyter NoteBook and Google Colab).
#### 4. Importing Libraries and their uses.
#### 5. Going through some basic and important libraries and their notebooks with examples.
#### 6. Understading Machine Learning Types and algorithms.
