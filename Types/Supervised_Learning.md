## What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.
It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances.

####                                        In Supervised Machine learning we deal with labelled data.

### Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.

### 1. Classification: 
   A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
### 2. Regression: 
   A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.
   
## Algorithms:
  Some widely used supervised machine learning algorithms are:
  * Support Vector Machines
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Naive Bias
  * Decision Tree 
  * KNN (K- nearest neighbour ) algorithm
  * Neural Network (Multilayer perceptron)
  * Similarity Learning

## Advantages of Machine Learning:
  * Supervised learning allows you to collect data or produce a data output from the previous experience
  * Helps you to optimize performance criteria using experience
  * Supervised machine learning helps you to solve various types of real-world computation problems.
  
## Disadvantages of Machine Learning:
  * Decision boundary might be overtrained if your training set which doesn't have examples that you want to have in a class
  * You need to select lots of good examples from each class while you are training the classifier.
  * Classifying big data can be a real challenge.
  * Training for supervised learning needs a lot of computation time.
  
## Supervised Machine Learning Summary:
  * In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well "labelled."
  * You want to train a machine which helps you predict how long it will take you to drive home from your workplace is an example of supervised learning
  * Regression and Classification are two types of supervised machine learning techniques.
  * Supervised learning is a simpler method while Unsupervised learning is a complex method.
  * The biggest challenge in supervised learning is that Irrelevant input feature present training data could give inaccurate results.
  * The main advantage of supervised learning is that it allows you to collect data or produce a data output from the previous experience.
  * The drawback of this model is that decision boundary might be overstrained if your training set doesn't have examples that you want to have in a class.
  * As a best practice of supervise learning, you first need to decide what kind of data should be used as a training set.
