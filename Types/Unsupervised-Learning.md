### Definition:
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labeled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization allows for modeling of probability densities over inputs.[1] It forms one of the three main categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning. Semi-supervised learning, a related variant, makes use of supervised and unsupervised techniques.

The major goal for the unsupervised learning is to help model the underlying structure or maybe in the distribution of the data in order to help the learners learn more about the data.

#### Unsupervised learning problems can even be grouped ahead into clustering and association problems.

### 1. ***Clustering: A clustering is that problem which indicates what you want to discover and this helps in the inherent groupings of the data, such as grouping the customers based on their purchasing behavior.***
### 2. ***Association:  An association rule is termed to be the learning problem. This is where you would be discovering the exact rules that will describe the large portions of your data. Example: People who buy X are also the one who tends to buy Y.***


### Some popular Unsupervised Learning algorithms:

5. Independent Component Analysis

### Clustering is a very important tool in case of unsupervised learning, So let's see what is Clustering.

Clustering is an important concept when it comes to unsupervised learning. It mainly deals with finding a structure or pattern in a collection of uncategorized data. Clustering algorithms will process your data and find natural clusters(groups) if they exist in the data. You can also modify how many clusters your algorithms should identify. It allows you to adjust the granularity of these groups.


### Clustering Types
#### 1.Hierarchical clustering
#### 2.K-means clustering
#### 3.K-NN (k nearest neighbors)
#### 4.Principal Component Analysis
#### 5.Singular Value Decomposition
#### 6.Independent Component Analysis

### Applications of unsupervised machine learning:
Some applications of unsupervised machine learning techniques are:

  * Clustering automatically split the dataset into groups base on their similarities
  * Anomaly detection can discover unusual data points in your dataset. It is useful for finding fraudulent transactions
  * Association mining identifies sets of items which often occur together in your dataset
  * Latent variable models are widely used for data preprocessing. Like reducing the number of features in a dataset or decomposing the dataset into multiple components
  
#### Summary:
 * Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model.
 * Unsupervised machine learning helps you to finds all kind of unknown patterns in data.
 * Clustering and Association are two types of Unsupervised learning.
 * Four types of clustering methods are 1) Exclusive 2) Agglomerative 3) Overlapping 4) Probabilistic.
 * Important clustering types are: 
    1)Hierarchical clustering 
    2) K-means clustering 
    3) K-NN 
    4) Principal Component Analysis 
    5) Singular Value Decomposition 
    6) Independent Component Analysis.
 * Association rules allow you to establish associations amongst data objects inside large databases.
 * In Supervised learning, Algorithms are trained using labelled data while in Unsupervised learning Algorithms are used against data which is not labelled.
 * Anomaly detection can discover important data points in your dataset which is useful for finding fraudulent transactions.
 * The biggest drawback of Unsupervised learning is that you cannot get precise information regarding data sorting.
